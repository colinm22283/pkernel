# PKernel

This is a fully custom UNIX-like kernel written for fun. The kernel is still currently WIP but supports many of the basic features of a UNIX system.

This repository is generally intended to a submodule of a larger build system such as [PKOS](https://cmcgann.com/projects/os).

# Building

The kernel can be build by running `make` in the top level directory. Assuming the proper compilers are installed on the system a binary of the kernel will be generated at `build/bin/kernel.bin`.
